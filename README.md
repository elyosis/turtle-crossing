# Turtle Crossing

A Turtle Crossing game implementation using Python and the `turtle` module.

Run `main.py` to start the game. Move the turtle forwards with the up arrow. Every time the turtle reaches safely the upper edge of the screen, a new level will begin and the cars will increase in speed. Upon game over, click the screen to exit the game.
